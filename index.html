        <h2>👋 Hello! My name is Greg March, and I'm a user experience designer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
            I've been designing software professionally for the last six years, take a look at what I've been working on —

      <h3>Senior UX Designer from March 2021 to Present<br>UX Designer from September 2019 to March 2021<h3>
      <p>I am currently employed as a Senior Product Designer at SAP SuccessFactors.
        SuccessFactors is a major HR software company that serves thousands of enterprise customers around the world.
        Its vast suite of human experience management (HXM) tools cover everything in an employee’s career from recruiting and training new hires to succession in retirement.
        Over my time at SuccessFactors I have had the opportunity to work on a number of product areas including Time Management, Performance Management, Qualtrics Analytics, Search, and the Homepage.
        I personally managed the full design process for most of my projects, and more recently am acting as full design owner and lead for the cross-module Search team.
      </p>

      <div>
      <p>During my time at SuccessFactors, the product has been going through a UX “reimagining”; a full redesign where everything is modernized from the ground up.
        I have personally participated in this redesign, and am partially responsible for the development and management of the new design system itself.
        The Homepage was the first experience to undergo the transition to the new visual style, and was recontextualized from an informational dashboard to a transactional workspace.
      </p>

      <div>
      <p>SuccessFactors is customer focused to its core.
        For projects like Feedback the ideal solutions can vary widely from company to company, so understanding the specific needs of each of our customers was a necessity.
        As project lead, I interfaced directly with many of our customer admins and business leaders to build a solution that met their goals, targeted their issues, and matched with our users' mental model.
        Feedback was fully redesigned to have more structured requests, more casual interactions, and upcoming integrations into Microsoft Outlook and Teams.
      </p>
      </div>

      <div class="image_fill">
      <img src="assets/sap/SAP3.png" alt="SuccessFactors Feedback iOS">
      </div>

      <div>
      <p>At SuccessFactors, everything is designed mobile-first and delivered simultaneously on iOS, Android, and responsive web.
        The typical design process at SuccessFactors is 2 to 6 months long (depending on topic complexity), and opens with a “design sprint” wherein all stakeholders (design, product, engineering, and writing/internationalization) are aligned and have the opportunity to contribute their thoughts and ideas to the initial design.
        Once an initial concept is agreed upon, the design team then produces a simple prototype for research purposes.
        At this stage, research can be as simple as a short survey or as complicated as weeks of comprehensive moderated user testing.
        With that research in hand, the UX design team begins to iterate towards a finished design.
        When the first iteration is complete, designers collect internal feedback (product, engineering, design leadership) as well as external feedback (customer design advisors, additional testing) and continue to use that insight to further polish their work.
        Once designers and stakeholders approve of the final design, development begins. As development moves forward, designers are constantly engaged to ensure that high standards are met and modifications can be made as needed.

      </div>

      <div>
      <p>Alongside the products I’ve worked on at SuccessFactors, another opportunity that I’ve found deeply rewarding has been the chance to mentor junior level designers.
        SAP has a program called SAP Next Talent wherein new grads transition between a few product teams at SAP, and I have had the pleasure of welcoming a few of them into my own team and helping them reach the next stage of their careers.
        Meeting View was one of the projects I led with junior designers, and we went through a rigorous process to fully rethink what the 1-on-1 meeting experience could be.
        I couldn’t be happier with what my teammates have achieved, and look forward to seeing where they go from here.<br><br>
        SuccessFactors is a serious force in its industry and only getting better from here.
        I continue to hone my craft every day alongside an extremely talented team, and I am proud to have worked on something that has touched (and hopefully improved) the lives of so many others.

      <h1><a href="https://ridecell.com/" target="_blank" id="rc">Ridecell</a></h1>
      <h3>Product Designer from July 2018 to September 2019</h3>
      <p>Ridecell is a mobility software company that provides a platform for companies to launch and run their own vehicle-sharing or ride-sharing services.
        Where Ridecell itself was quite small and did not have its own vehicles or drivers, the software they produced powered a number of services around the world including Ferrovial’s “Zity” in Madrid and Paris, BMW’s “ReachNow” in Seattle, AAA’s “Gig Car Share” in the Bay Area, and Google’s “GRide” and “Waymo” in Mountain View and Phoenix.
        What Ridecell provides comes fundamentally in three parts: a web-based system for dispatchers, a native iOS and Android application for drivers or maintenance workers, and another native iOS and Android application for riders.
        Over my time at Ridecell I had the opportunity to work closely on all three of these.
      </p>
      </div>

      <div class="image_fill">
      <img src="assets/rc/RC.png" alt="Ridecell">
      </div>

      <div>
      <p>The design process at Ridecell was self-driven and had lots of opportunities for collaboration.
        After discussing any given task with the relevant product and engineering team, a researcher would often take to the streets to learn as much as they could first-hand from real riders and dispatchers or using real vehicles and infrastructure.
        With that knowledge in hand, each team member was given a huge amount of personal ownership and encouraged to really experiment and evolve the design.
        We then set aside one day of every week to critique and collaborate on each other’s work as a collective, both boosting and grounding our personal processes.
        Once the design team was in alignment and engineering was on board, development could begin.
        After a bit more than a year, I left Ridecell to seek opportunities at larger, more stable companies.
        Ridecell continues to create excellent mobility experiences for their clients.

      <h1><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/discidium-technologies" target="_blank" id="rc">Discidium</a></h1>
      <h3>Founding Designer from October 2017 to June 2018</h3>
      <p>Discidium, now defunct, was an academically focused Machine Learning as a Service company that worked to provide tools to quickly and easily model and publish research data without the need to write code.
        This was done through a web-based client using AWS resources.
        Not only was I the UX designer for the full experience, but as the first and only designer at the company I had the opportunity to develop the design process and system, owning effectively every role in the design space from research to release.
      </p>
      </div>

      </div>

      <div>
      <p>We started our process by meeting with researchers at Stanford and data scientists at Google, gauging interest and learning about what services we could provide in our space.
        Once we got a solid grasp of the problem at hand and how we wanted to solve it, we slowly started to build up the design system and codebase from scratch.
        As the first simple pieces formed, the application grew into a fuller and more functional design powered by an increasingly complete backend.
        As we became settled on the design and front end development began in earnest, in an unfortunate turn of events, the company started to have financial issues and was forced to dissolve before the product could be completed.
        Working at Discidium forced me to confront many of my gaps as a designer, and even though in the end things didn’t work out as we’d hoped, it was an incredible learning experience and I’m glad I had the opportunity to really push myself and grow.

      <h3>Senior Product Designer from October 2016 to October 2017<br>Product Designer from October 2015 to October 2016</h3>
      <p>Ascendify is an enterprise class HR software company that, at the time of my hiring, was focused on creating applicant tracking and recruiting systems for major customers including GE, Cisco, and Panasonic.
        During my time there the company roughly doubled in size and grew its functionality to include employee assessments and internal growth opportunities.
        I had the chance to work on nearly every part of the application in both a research and design capacity.

      <img src="assets/asc/ASC.png" alt="Ascendify">
      </div>

      <div>
      <p>Our design process began with customer user interviews and guided research sessions to get aligned on the task at hand and ensure we understood how best to approach the problem.
        From here each designer was given a lot of autonomy and allowed to experiment with solutions, which were then reviewed in regular design critiques and weekly pulse meetings with customers to ensure we got continuous feedback.
        Once everyone from design and engineering had signed off, development could begin. <br><br>
        More so than any of the work I completed at Ascendify, what I got most out of my time there was a learning experience that will last the rest of my career.
        It was my first time doing design work in a professional setting, and as a member of such a small team I received direct mentorship and the chance to flesh out my skill set and take the first big step into being the designer I am today.

      <h3>Bachelor of Science Student from September 2011 to June 2015</h3>
      <p>The Computer Science: Game Design BS at the University of California, Santa Cruz is a program where students are provided the resources to design and develop full release software and games in addition a traditional computer science curriculum.
        Over the course of achieving my degree I completed four games, one per year.
        The first was a puzzle platformer called “Utapei” made in GameMaker, the second was a JavaScript turn-based real-time hybrid strategy game called “Temps Perdu”, the third was a procedurally generated top-down shooter called “The Narrows” developed in Unity for the Microsoft Surface, and the final project was a first person VR puzzle game called “Jamais Vu” developed for PC in the Unreal engine with specific support for the Oculus Rift.

      <div>
      <p>After graduating university, I've continued to design games as a personal hobby.
        Though aren’t polished or relevant enough to appear in this portfolio, one good example is my iOS game <a href="https://apps.apple.com/al/app/tempire/id1488269708" target="_blank" id="rc">Tempire</a>, which is an iteration on my old university project "Temps Perdu".
        Tempire was released with local play and online play via Game Center in 2016, and was updated with AI opponents in 2020.
        It was designed by me and developed my friend <a href="https://www.marmphco.com/" target="_blank" id="rc">Matthew Jee</a>, with music from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobrhein/" target="_blank" id="rc">Jacob Rhein</a>.
