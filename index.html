      <h3>Senior UX Designer from March 2021 to Present<br>UX Designer from September 2019 to March 2021</h3>
      <p> &emsp;&emsp; SAP SuccessFactors is a major enterprise HR tech company serving hundreds of millions of users across thousands of customers.
        Over my tenure, I’ve had the opportunity to lead a number of product design teams, including those for Search, Performance Management, and Learning.
        Currently, I am the <span class="pop">Design System Lead for SuccessFactors Business AI.</span>
        Within each product, I’ve been responsible for defining and facilitating the full design process, leading and mentoring more junior designers, and contributing directly to the final design specifications.

      <h5>🏢  Pixel Perfect, Enterprise Scale</h5>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp; My work has always been customer-driven and data-focused.
        As with all enterprise companies, design at SuccessFactors requires a careful balance between the needs of end users and our customer partners.
        Over the years, alongside UX research, I’ve personally worked with business leaders from around the world to bring out the best in their companies.<br>
        &emsp;&emsp; While accessibility had been passively integrated at my previous companies, SuccessFactors makes the effort to put equitable and inclusive design first.
        Every solution is underpinned not only by high-fidelity design work across responsive web, iOS, and Android, but by a full suite of accessibility specifications that ensure a barrier-free experience for everyone.
        It’s been a valuable learning experience, and something I’ve been proud to participate in.

      <h5>🧑‍🏫  Leadership and Mentorship</h5>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp; Being part of the same team for five-plus years, I’ve had the opportunity to bring junior designers under my wing.
        This started with helping along members of SAP’s student and graduate program, SAP Next Talent, but evolved into mentoring mid-level and even senior designers.
        Company culture is always a top priority for me - it’s been an incredible pleasure to be surrounded by such kind and talented people, and a great joy to further elevate those around me.

      <div>
      <h5>❇️  Modern Technologies</h5>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp; SuccessFactors has undergone a significant design overhaul since I originally joined in 2019.
        During that process many portions of the application had reimagined from the ground up, and that’s given me the chance to really spread my wings as both a designer and design leader.
        Whether you’re giving feedback to your report, searching for a mentor, or staying up-to-date on your learning, I’ve worked on it all.<br>
        &emsp;&emsp; I’m currently the Design System Lead for SuccessFactors Business AI, which is our effort to implement generative artificial intelligence throughout the platform and beyond.
        This work encompasses all SuccessFactors modules, requiring collaboration and influence across several of SAP’s lines of business.
        I’m excited to be working in such an impactful role, and to be solving new problems with cutting edge technologies.

      <h3>Product Designer from July 2018 to September 2019</h3>
      <p>Ridecell is a mobility software company that provides a platform for companies to launch and run their own vehicle-sharing or ride-sharing services.
        I worked on Ferrovial’s “Zity” in Madrid and Paris, BMW’s “ReachNow” in Seattle, AAA’s “Gig Car Share” in the Bay Area, and Google’s “GRide” service in Mountain View.
        Each of these services included a web-based system for dispatchers, an internal mobile application for drivers or maintenance workers, and a customer facing mobile application for riders.

      <h5>🚗  Always Accelerating</h5>
      <p>During my time at Ridecell, the company went through a phase of booming growth.
        Our vehicle and customer counts ballooned, the company nearly doubled in size, and the design team evolved dramatically.
        It was an excellent exercise in scaling, structuring, and self-direction.

      <p>As a very small company in a quickly evolving field, Discidium had a number of unique challenges.

      <h3>Bachelor of Science Student from September 2011 to June 2015</h3>
      <p>The Computer Science: Game Design BS at the University of California, Santa Cruz is a program where students are provided the resources to design and develop full release software and games in addition a traditional computer science curriculum.
        Over the course of achieving my degree I completed four games, one per year.
        The first was a puzzle platformer called “Utapei” made in GameMaker, the second was a JavaScript turn-based real-time hybrid strategy game called “Temps Perdu”, the third was a procedurally generated top-down shooter called “The Narrows” developed in Unity for the Microsoft Surface, and the final project was a first person VR puzzle game called “Jamais Vu” developed for PC in the Unreal engine with specific support for the Oculus Rift.

      <h5>🎮  Continued Passion</h5>
      <p>After graduating university, I've continued to design games as a personal hobby.
        Though most of these aren’t polished or relevant enough to appear in this portfolio, one good example is my iOS game <a href="https://apps.apple.com/al/app/tempire/id1488269708" target="_blank" id="rc">Tempire</a>, which was an interation on my old university project "Temps Perdu".
        Tempire was released with local play and online play via Game Center in 2016, and was updated with AI in 2020.
        It was designed by me and developed by my friend <a href="https://www.marmphco.com/" target="_blank" id="rc">Matt Jee</a>, with music from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobrhein/" target="_blank" id="rc">Jacob Rhein</a>.
