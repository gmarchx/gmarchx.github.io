      <h3>Senior UX Designer from March 2021 to Present<br>UX Designer from September 2019 to March 2021</h3>
      <p>SAP SuccessFactors is a major HR software company that serves thousands of enterprise customers around the world.
        Over my time at the company I‚Äôve led a number of product areas, including Search, Performance Management, and Learning.
        Within each area, I‚Äôve been responsible for defining and facilitating the full design process from research to final implementation while mentoring more junior designers and collaborating as an individual contributor.

      <br>

      <div>
      <p>I‚Äôm currently the design owner and lead for one of SuccessFactors core products - Learning.
        Since I took charge of the module over a year ago, Learning has undergone a complete redesign and modernization.
        During this process, I‚Äôve been engaged both in and outside of my product area, pushing the bounds of the platform forward and evolving SAP‚Äôs foundational Fiori design system.
        Over the course of the year, the team has been fortunate enough to see our efforts rewarded with significant increases to our user base and a number of new major customers.

      <div>
      <p> My design work is always customer driven and data focused.
        Projects at SuccessFactors often require a careful balance of user input, impact analysis, and the administrative vision of our partners.
        I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work directly with incredible business leaders to provide unique experiences that bring out the best in their companies.
        Every solution is underpinned by high-fidelity, pixel-perfect design work across responsive web, iOS, and Android.

      <p>SuccessFactors is only getting better from here.
        Through the continued efforts of a talented team, and the integration of modern AI technologies, there are incredible things just around the corner.
        I‚Äôm proud to work on something that touches (and hopefully improves) the lives of so many others.

      <h1><a href="https://ridecell.com/" target="_blank" id="rc">Ridecell</a></h1>
      <h3>Product Designer from July 2018 to September 2019</h3>
      <p>Ridecell is a mobility software company that provides a platform for companies to launch and run their own vehicle-sharing or ride-sharing services.
        I worked on Ferrovial‚Äôs ‚ÄúZity‚Äù in Madrid and Paris, BMW‚Äôs ‚ÄúReachNow‚Äù in Seattle, AAA‚Äôs ‚ÄúGig Car Share‚Äù in the Bay Area, and Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúGRide‚Äù service in Mountain View.
        Each of these services included a web-based system for dispatchers, an internal mobile application for drivers or maintenance workers, and a customer facing mobile application for riders.

      <div>
      <p>During my time at Ridecell, the company went through a phase of booming growth.
        Our vehicle and customer counts ballooned, the company nearly doubled in size, and the design team evolved dramatically.
        It was an excellent exercise in scaling, structuring, and self-direction.

      <p>Discidium was an academically focused AI startup that was building a collaborative marketplace for ML models and data.
        As the founding designer, I was responsible for establishing the brand, design system, and full application from the ground up.

      <div>
      <p>As a very small company, Discidium had a number of unique challenges.
        I‚Äôm thankful for my first opportunity to build a product from scratch, as well as a chance to become more familiar with technology as a business.

      <p>AAscendify was an enterprise class HR software company that focused on creating applicant tracking and recruiting systems for major customers including GE, Cisco, and Panasonic.
        During my time there the company roughly doubled in size and grew its functionality to include employee assessments and internal growth opportunities.
        I had the chance to work on nearly every part of the application in both a research and design capacity.

      <h3>Bachelor of Science Student from September 2011 to June 2015</h3>
      <p>The Computer Science: Game Design BS at the University of California, Santa Cruz is a program where students are provided the resources to design and develop full release software and games in addition a traditional computer science curriculum.
        Over the course of achieving my degree I completed four games, one per year.
        The first was a puzzle platformer called ‚ÄúUtapei‚Äù made in GameMaker, the second was a JavaScript turn-based real-time hybrid strategy game called ‚ÄúTemps Perdu‚Äù, the third was a procedurally generated top-down shooter called ‚ÄúThe Narrows‚Äù developed in Unity for the Microsoft Surface, and the final project was a first person VR puzzle game called ‚ÄúJamais Vu‚Äù developed for PC in the Unreal engine with specific support for the Oculus Rift.

      <div>
      <p>After graduating university, I've continued to design games as a personal hobby.
        Though most of these aren‚Äôt polished or relevant enough to appear in this portfolio, one good example is my iOS game <a href="https://apps.apple.com/al/app/tempire/id1488269708" target="_blank" id="rc">Tempire</a>, which was an interation on my old university project "Temps Perdu".
        Tempire was released with local play and online play via Game Center in 2016, and was updated with AI in 2020.
        It was designed by me and developed by my friend <a href="https://www.marmphco.com/" target="_blank" id="rc">Matt Jee</a>, with music from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobrhein/" target="_blank" id="rc">Jacob Rhein</a>.
